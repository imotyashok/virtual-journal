# Virtual Journal
Welcome to the Virtual Journal project! If you're someone who loves the idea of expressing themselves through writing and art but lacks the time to draw and write everything out by hand, then this might be the tool for you! The virtual journal will allow you to do just about anything a physical journal would without the hassle.

## Objectives
- Users will be able to log in to the site 
- Users can save, edit, and create their journal(s)
- Users can add text and images to the journal pages
    - Text can have different fonts, sizes, and colors
    - Images can be resized, rotated, and placed anywhere within the bounds of the journal page 
- When a user is finished with their journal, they'll have the option of ordering a physical copy 
    - User can export their journal as some sort of file, probably PDF (easy version)
    - A publishing company prints out a physical copy of the journal   (hard version)
